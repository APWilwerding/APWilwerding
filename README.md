- 👋 Hi, I’m @APWilwerding
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and software development for scientific and engineering aplications primarily. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning julia and java. I have dabbled in C++, MATLAB, Python, and LabVIEW and would like to stay current in those languages as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any scientific computing project especially mechanical vibration signal processing.
- 📫 How to reach me: email is ewilwerding@gmail.com
